# KanbanBoard

Super simple Kanban board with one simple list and tiles. Build using Angular. This is just a proof of concept to see how muvh time it will take to use DnD along with angular. And try new Angular CLI, which is great btw.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
